2 cups vegetable broth* ($0.18)
1 Tbsp soy sauce ($0.06)

Instructions 
Combine the vegetable broth, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, and the white parts of a sliced green onion in a medium-sized pot. (If using, also add the fish sauce, pre-cooked proteins or tofu, and any fresh or frozen vegetables that need time to soften.)
Bring the broth up to a boil on medium-high heat. Once boiling, add the dumplings.
Cover the pot and allow the soup to come back up to a boil. Boil the dumplings for about 2 minutes or until they are cooked through. (Consult package directions.)
Turn off the heat and stir in the green parts of the sliced green onion and a handful of spinach.
Split the soup into 2 serving bowls and top with any desired condiments.
