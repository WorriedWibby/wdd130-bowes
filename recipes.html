                <ul><b>Ingredients</b>
                    <li>2 Tbsp olive oil ($0.44)</li>
                    <li>1 yellow onion ($0.70)</li>

                    <li>1 inch fresh ginger ($0.16)</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 Tbsp curry powder ($0.45)</li>
                    <li>8 oz. spinach (fresh or frozen, $1.04)</li>
                    <li>1 15 oz. can tomato sauce ($1.06)</li>
                    <li>2 15 oz. cans chickpeas ($1.88)</li>

                <p><b>Instructions</b><br>
                    Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and grate the ginger on a small holed cheese grater. Sauté the onion, garlic, and ginger in a large skillet with the olive oil over medium heat until the onions have softened (3-5 minutes).
                    Add the curry powder and continue to sauté with the onion mixture for one minute more. Add about 1/4 cup of water to the skillet along with the fresh spinach and continue to sauté until the spinach has wilted. The water will help steam and wilt the spinach (no water needed if using frozen spinach).
                    Drain and rinse the chickpeas. Add them to the skillet along with the tomato sauce. Stir well to distribute the spices in the sauce and heat through (5 minutes). Serve over rice or with bread.

                    Combine the vegetable broth, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, and the white parts of a sliced green onion in a medium-sized pot. (If using, also add the fish sauce, pre-cooked proteins or tofu, and any fresh or frozen vegetables that need time to soften.)

            <h3>Pesto Mac and Cheese</h3>
                <ul><b>Ingredients</b>
                    <li>2 cups uncooked macaroni ($0.50)</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp butter ($0.22)</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp all-purpose flour ($0.02)</li>
                    <li>2 cups whole milk ($0.60)</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan ($0.53)</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup basil pesto ($0.55)</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp salt ($0.02)</li>
                    <li>Freshly cracked pepper ($0.03)</li>
                    <li>1/2 lb. frozen spinach ($0.80)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Instructions</b><br>
                    Thaw the spinach at room temperature or in the microwave. Squeeze out the excess water. Set the spinach aside. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then add the macaroni. Boil for 7-10 minutes, or until tender. Drain the macaroni in a colander.
                    While the pasta is boiling, prepare the sauce. Add the butter and flour to a small sauce pot. Heat and stir the butter and flour over medium heat until it forms a creamy paste and begins to bubble. Continue to stir and cook for about one minute more.
                    Whisk the milk into the butter and flour, then allow it to come up to a simmer, while whisking. When it reaches a simmer, the sauce will thicken. Remove the sauce from the heat.
                    Whisk the Parmesan and pesto into the sauce until smooth. This will further thicken the sauce. Season the sauce with salt and freshly cracked pepper. Make sure the sauce is well seasoned as the flavors will be less concentrated once the pasta and spinach are stirred in.
                    Return the cooked and drained pasta to the large pot (heat turned off) and add the thawed spinach. Pour the sauce over top, then stir until everything is combined and coated in sauce. Serve immediately.
